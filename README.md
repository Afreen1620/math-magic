# MathMagic 🧙‍♂️✨

The `mathmagic` library is a simple Python package that provides basic mathematical operations. This project serves as a tutorial for learning how to use GitHub for collaboration, while also creating a functional library that can be extended and used in various projects.

## Introduction 📘

This project was developed as part of an educational exercise to learn how GitHub can be utilized for collaborating on code projects. It features a simple set of functions that perform arithmetic operations, which are packaged into a Python library.

## Features 🔥

- Basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗
  - Floor Division 🧱
  - Modulus 🔣
  - Square Root √
- Easy to install 💾
- Simple to use in any Python project 🐍

## Installation 💻

To install `mathmagic`, clone this repository and run the installation command from the root directory of the project:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/junioralive/math-magic/releases/download/1.0.0/mathmagic-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
pip install mathmagic-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Usage 📚

Once installed, you can use the `mathmagic` library in your Python scripts as follows:
